# Neural Network from Scratch - MNIST Classifier

This project is an implementation of a simple **feedforward neural network** trained on the **MNIST dataset**, based on Michael Nielsenâ€™s *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*.

## Features
- Implements **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** with backpropagation.
- Uses **sigmoid activation** and **L2 regularization**.
- Trains on the **MNIST** dataset (handwritten digits).
- Runs with only `numpy` and `tensorflow` for dataset loading.

## Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuralNetwork-MNIST.git
cd NeuralNetwork-MNIST
